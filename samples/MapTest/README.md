# MapTest

This app works on React Native (iOS, Android) and web.

### Initial Setup

- Run `npm install`. This fetches the dependencies.

### Building for Web

- Run `npm run build`. This transpiles the ES6 code.
- Open `index.html` in your browser to view the result.

### Building for React Native

- In a command prompt run `npm run rn.watch`. This transpiles the ES6 code and watches for changes
- In a command prompt run `npm android` or `npm ios`. This starts the React Native Packager and deploys your application.
